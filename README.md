# Phase 1 — Aviation Risk Analysis ✈️

##  Project Overview
Air travel is widely considered one of the safest modes of transport, yet aviation incidents still occur globally.  
This project examines historical aviation accident data to uncover risk patterns and important safety insights, such as:

- When aviation incidents occur most frequently
- Aircraft types and environments associated with higher risk
- Geographical hotspots for accidents
- Accident severity outcomes and contributing factors

The objective is to provide actionable insights that can guide aviation safety stakeholders in decision-making and risk reduction.

##  Business Relevance
Aviation safety authorities, airline companies, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators rely on data-driven evidence to:

- Improve pilot and crew safety training programs
- Enhance regulatory oversight and compliance
- Detect mechanical and operational risks early
- Reduce accident severity and prevent fatalities
- Support safer air travel for the global community

##  Project Objectives
1. Analyze aviation accident frequency and distribution over time  
2. Identify aircraft configurations and flight phases with heightened risk  
3. Examine environmental and operational contributing factors  
4. Assess injury severity to support targeted safety improvements
